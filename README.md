# gopherhole

My version of the logic puzzle game "Tents and Trees" by the folks at [Froxaz](https://www.frozax.com/). I've enjoyed playing their game on my phone and providing the inspiration! `gopherhole` has the same basic mechanics and rules, just runs in your terminal and uses gophers and holes instead of tents and trees. The game is like a mix of picross puzzles and minesweeper.

**Objective:** Use logic place gophers next to holes on the map so that each gopher has its own hole. The numbers around the board inform you how many gophers should be in each row/column.

## Game Rules

1. Each hole on the grid must have a gopher next to it.
1. The numbers around the board indicate how many gophers belong in each row or column.
1. Gophers must be places in one of the four vertically or horizontally adjacent holes. (Not diagonally)
1. Gophers cannot be placed withing the 8 surrounding squares of another gopher.
