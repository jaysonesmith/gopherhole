# gopherhole

*screenshot tbd*

`gopherhole` is a game where you use logic to place gophers next to holes on the map so that each gopher has its own hole. The numbers around the board inform you how many gophers should be in each row/column. The game is like a mix of picross puzzles and minesweeper.

## Game Rules

1. Each hole on the grid must have a gopher next to it.
1. The numbers around the board indicate how many gophers belong in each row or column.
1. Gophers must be places in one of the four vertically or horizontally adjacent holes. (Not diagonally)
1. Gophers cannot be placed withing the 8 surrounding squares of another gopher.

I've enjoyed playing their game on my phone and through some thinking about writing something to solve levels decided to write my own version of the game.
