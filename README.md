# gopherhole

My version of the logic puzzle game "Tents and Trees" by the folks at [Froxaz](https://www.frozax.com/) I've enjoyed playing their game on my phone and want to thank them for the inspiration! It has the same mechanics and rules, just runs in your terminal and uses gophers and their holes instead of tents and trees.
